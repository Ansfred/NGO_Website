    <h4 class="para"> As the world’s hunger specialist, our primary goal is to create a 
        better way to deal with <br> hunger. For more than 40 years, we have led
        the global  movement that aims to end life- <br> threatening hunger for good within
        our lifetimes.  Our teams have been on the front lines, <br> treating and preventing malnutrition
        across more than 45  countries. <br>
        We save the lives of children and their families. We are there for them before and after <br> disaster
        strikes. 
        We enable people to provide for themselves, see their children grow up<br> strong, 
        and for whole communities to prosper. We constantly search for more effective <br>solutions, while 
        sharing our knowledge and expertise with the world. We push for long-term change.</h4> <br> <br>

        <p class="para">About 811 million people go to bed hungry every night, and one in three children in low-<br>
