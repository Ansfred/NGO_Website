              <h3>THRIVE MONTHLY GIVING</h3>
              <p>Join our monthly giving community and help us reach more children in need. <br>

                Malnutrition is the single greatest threat to child survival worldwide. For nearly half of the 5.3 million children who don’t live to see their fifth birthday, hunger is a reason why. <br>
                
                We know how to help these children. Hunger is a predictable, preventable, and treatable illness. For more than 40 years, Action Against Hunger has been leading a movement to save lives and improve the health of the world’s most vulnerable children. <br>
                
                THRIVE is a community of monthly donors dedicated to helping us reach more children in need. Monthly donors are with us in 45+ countries, in every major emergency in the world, helping to save lives, empower communities, and ensure more children can grow up strong.</p>

              <h3>HOW DOES IT WORK?</h3>
              <p><ol>
                  <li>Choose an amount. Right now, most people are giving $50/month – that’s the average cost to provide the full course of lifesaving hunger treatment for one child.</li>
                  <li>Fight hunger with us for one child at a time. THRIVE members make a monthly gift that is automatically transferred from a credit or debit account on the same day each month, and can be adjusted or stopped at any time </li>
                  <li>Join our lifesaving community. Stay informed and spread the word! As a THRIVE member, you will receive special updates from the field about how your support is helping more children survive and thrive. We’ll also offer you a special welcome gift to help you raise awareness in your community.</li>
