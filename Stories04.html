                <h2>THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN 2021.</h2>
                <p>It's Donor Appreciation Week at Action Against Hunger! 

                    Last year, Action Against Hunger reached more than 25 million individuals in nearly 50 countries, more than any previous year. Our record-breaking impact would not have been possible without the extraordinary generosity and dedication of our donors.

                    <p>From New York to Nairobi, people like you are taking action by donating, fundraising, and spreading the word. In the past year, we’ve seen our supporters donate their birthdays, organize creative events, join our THRIVE monthly giving community, and invent whole new ways to give like auctioning NFTs and donating cryptocurrency. We are amazed by your creativity and compassion!  </p>
                    <p>As conflict, climate shocks, and the COVID-19 pandemic drive increasing rates of hunger, our lifesaving programs have never been more critical. Donors like you make it possible for Action Against Hunger to reach more children and families in need around the world. </p>
